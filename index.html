    <p class="aboutMe">Hello! My name is Jessica and I am an up and coming programmer. I am currently going to school in San Antonio, Texas for an Associates in Science in Computer Programming. My first language was C++, and I am currently learing JavaScript and CSS. I have been in the military for over 5 years specializing in intelligence, and foreign languages. My end goal is to become a front-end developer and learn even more about computer languages and networking. So please, make yourself at home and familiarize yourself with my projects. I look forward to working with you!</p>
